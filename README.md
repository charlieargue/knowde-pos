# Quick Start

## Setup environment variables

You will need to grab a `.env` environment variable file:
```
游띔 The back-end will not work without the correct .env files!
```

```sh
# copy env file distribution version
cp .env.dist .env

# make sure to fill it out with the PostgreSQL username/password, see below...
```

## Setup database

To setup your PosgreSQL database, execute the following commands:
```sh

# install PosgreSQL
# (see https://brew.sh/ for how to install brew)
# (you maybe prompted to create a SA password, remember it, keep it simple)
brew install postgresql

# confirm installed correctly, check version:
postgres -V

# create a database user (游리 all these to your username):
# (this should be the username you enter in your .env file!)
# First enter (twice) a new password for THIS NEW USER (keep it simple)
# (you will be prompted for the SA password at the end)
sudo su postgres -c 'createuser -P --superuser 游리karlgolka游리'

# make a database (you will need to enter the USER PASSWORD)
sudo su postgres -c 'createdb knowde-pos -U 游리karlgolka游리'

# make sure to save this USER PASSWORD back in your .env file!

```

## Start up the server

# start the typescript compiler (游리 in one terminal window)
yarn watch
```

```sh
# start the server locally (游리 in another terminal window)
